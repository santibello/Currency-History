# Currency-History

Countries experiencing extreme currency crises often find themselves resorting to the private sector to issue money. There are three case studies presented that have been selected because of their strong relevance to the topic: Great Britain in the Industrial Revolution relied on private coinage, America in the Great Depression used a vast array of different paper scrips, and Zimbabwe during its hyperinflation did most transactions with the US dollar. The general conclusion reached is that through these crises, individuals have an opportunity to determine what they collectively believe to be the most desirable monetary system. As a result the monetary system factors in more insight into the functions of money than any government would be able to consider.
